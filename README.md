## About The Project
<h3>The Client<h3>
  
Cotiss is built specifically to help organisations be more effective in how they buy & supply goods and services. They’re a B2B company that creates software for companies to track their spending and make better business decisions. 

  <h3>The Project<h3>
    As Cotiss has grown over the years, the need for collecting feedback internally and externally has become a more prominent issue. Cotiss leadership is looking for a simple website where employees can anonymously submit feedback. To encourage employees to share honestly, they want a randomly selected piece of existing feedback to be displayed on the site on each page load. 

The UX design is simple; a random piece of feedback displayed on each page load, and a box at the bottom of the page with a submit button to add new feedback to the feedback bank.
